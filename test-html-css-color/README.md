### Test code

Code to test whether or not my guess on a question was correct. Turns out I was wrong, but that what the test was for.

**How to run**:

```
kendall@kendall-XPS-8500:~/Development/el-toro-project/test-html-css-color$ python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
```

Go to browser: `localhost:8000`
