## Interview Project

Included in this repository is a collection of directories, where each directory answers a single question. Please refer to individual directories for their respective README files.

This repository has been submitted in conjunction with a PDF document answering all other questions.

NOTE: I used Python version 3.4.x for all questions except the web scraping program found in `scrape-twitter` where I used Python version 2.7.x.
